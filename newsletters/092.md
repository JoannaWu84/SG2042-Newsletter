# SG2042 Newsletter (2025-05-16 #092)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the ninety-second issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. In this issue, we bring you a series of news over Milk-V Duo.

## Highlights

+ Recently, the 6th Intelligent Vehicle Competition concluded successfully at Shandong University. This year's competition adopted the RISC-V-based Milk-V Duo development board as the core control platform, attracting numerous teams to compete fiercely in intelligent perception, autonomous decision-making, and precise control. The event not only demonstrated the potential of RISC-V open-source hardware in embedded systems and AI applications but also provided students with an innovative platform to explore autonomous driving technologies. It further advanced the integration of domestic chip ecosystems and intelligent control technologies. For more details, please refer to our [Events and Games](#Events-and-Games) section.
