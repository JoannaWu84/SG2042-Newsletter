# SG2042 Newsletter (2024-04-26 #039)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the thirty-ninth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. In this issue, we will bring you the content about the RISC-V Open Source Software and Hardware Development Forum. Hope you will enjoy this update.

## Highlights

+ On April 24, 2024, the RISC-V Open Source Software and Hardware Development Forum, themed around "Open Source and Industry-Education Integration", was successfully held at Shandong University. During this forum, the world's first commercially available server cluster based on the RISC-V architecture, "Dongshan", jointly deployed by Shandong University and SOPHGO, was officially unveiled. This significant step marks the formal launch of the cluster and opens a new chapter in the development of RISC-V technology.
