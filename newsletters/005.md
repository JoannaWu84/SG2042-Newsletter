## Editor's Note

Welcome to the fifth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. 

## Highlights


## Upstream

Most of the code is already open-source and can be obtained from repositories such as github.com/SOPHGO. The following are some useful repo resources:

### Linux kernel

https://github.com/sophgo/linux-riscv

### U-Boot

https://github.com/sophgo/u-boot/tree/sg2042-dev

### OpenSBI

https://github.com/sophgo/opensbi/tree/sg2042-dev

We're looking for fun, good, or profitable use cases for SG2042. Feel free to share your experiences with us - [just send a PR!](https://github.com/sophgocommunity/SG2042-Newsletter/pulls)
