# SG2042 Newsletter (2023-09-29 #010)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the tenth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. 

## Highlights

## Upstream

Most of the code is already open-source and can be obtained from repositories such as github.com/SOPHGO. The following are some useful repo resources:

### Linux kernel

+ Sophgo Community work: https://github.com/sophgo/linux-riscv

  + 

+ Linux Official Community Upstream work:

  + [[PATCH v3 00/11] Add Milk-V Pioneer RISC-V board support](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/cover.1695804418.git.unicornxw@gmail.com/): the minimal system submitted version 3 patches, and the community responded that there were still some minor issues, but `"v3 looks better indeed. I had some comments on the bindings and dt patches, but none were particularly major."`.


### U-Boot
