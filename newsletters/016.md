# SG2042 Newsletter (2023-11-10 #016)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the sixteenth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. We are excited to bring you the great news that the software ecosystem of the SG2042 server has achieved a significant breakthrough.

## Highlights

+ Under the leadership of Professor Hongjun Dai, the research team has successfully merged the first UEFI boot solution for RISC-V CPU servers into the EDK2 mainline repository. This accomplishment marks the completion of the first UEFI compliant firmware development for RISC-V servers. It enables the overall boot solution of “EDK2 - GRUB2 - Linux kernel” on the SOHGO's high-performance RISC-V product SG2042.

  The achievement of this milestone signifies that the RISC-V architecture, following in the footsteps of the x86 and ARM architectures, can be rapidly integrated into the server industry with the mature ecosystem of UEFI, which enhances the server software ecosystem of the first server-grade processor SG2042.

+ On November 2, 2023, SOPHGO's CV1800B and SG2042 achieved initial support for merging into the Linux 6.7 mainline. This is the first time that SOPHGO's products have been officially supported and maintained by Linux, and the first two processors from the RISC-V camp to join the Linux 6.7 mainline.
