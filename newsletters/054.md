## Editor's Note

Welcome to the fifty-fourth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. On August 5th, 2024, the summer training camp, hosted by  SOPHGO and organized by the School of Integrated Circuits at Shandong University, officially began in Beijing. The camp was attended by 25 students from Shandong University. For more details, please refer to our [Events and Games](#Events-and-Games) section.

## Highlights

+ Due to the tight competition schedule, many participants felt they were unable to fully showcase their abilities. To give all the challenge enthusiasts another opportunity to show their strength, the extended timing for the 2nd RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship has officially started!
