## Upstream

Most of the code is already open-source and can be obtained from repositories such as github.com/SOPHGO. The following are some useful repo resources:

### Linux kernel

+ Sophgo Community work: https://github.com/sophgo/linux-riscv

  + No commits this week

+ Linux Official Community Upstream work:

  + [[PATCH v3 0/4] riscv: sophgo: add reset support for SG2042][lk-1]: Add reset support for SG2042, version 3.
  + [[PATCH 0/1] RISC-V Devicetrees fix for Sophgo/SG2042 v6.8-rc1][lk-2]: A patch related to SBI is missing in v6.8-rc1. Without this patch, the current DTS check will fail. This missing patch [has been merged into v6.8-rc2][lk-3]. It should be noted that to match this version of the kernel, you need to use the newer OpenSBI v1.4 or later. The corresponding OpenSBI patch is [[PATCH v2] lib: utils/fdt: Allow to use reg-names when parsing ACLINT][lk-4].
  + After creating the new [Sophgo Platform Maintain warehouse][lk-7] (for details, please see [Related reports in the previous issue of SG2042 Newsletter][lk-8]), we registered `for-next` & `fixes` branches with the linux-next tree, see related ["mail 1"][lk-5] and ["mail 2"][lk-6]. By convention, the `fixes` branch is mainly used to collect bugfix patches found in the current development period (for example, the development version at the time of this news-letter is v6.8) since the release of rc1; while the `for-next` branch is used to collect the new-feature patches which are fully reviewed and have got tags (Reviewed-by or Acked-by) from relevant maintainers, and be waiting to be incorporated into the next development version (for example, the next development version at the time of this news-letter is v6.9). The collection work of the `for-next` branch will generally be started around rc6 in the current development cycle .
  + Created a new wiki website for [Sophgo Platform Maintain repository][lk-7]: <https://github.com/sophgo/linux/wiki>. We will use it to update and release the progress of Sophgo-related product mainline in real time. If you find that the relevant information is not the latest, please contact us in time for updates.
