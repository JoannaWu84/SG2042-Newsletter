## Editor's Note

Welcome to the sixty-first issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. Recently, registration for the 2024 CCF Big Data & Computing Intelligence Contest has officially begun. SOPHGO is providing the competition with a challenge titled “OCR Model Performance Optimization Based on TPU Platform.” Additionally, 100 Milk-V Duo development boards have been prepared for the participants. Competitors will leverage the TPU computing power on the Duo series development boards to improve the running speed of OCR models on edge devices. For more details, please refer to our [Events and Games](#Events-and-Games) section.

## Highlights

+ The results verification for the extended round of the 2nd RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship has been completed.
