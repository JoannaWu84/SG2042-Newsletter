# SG2042 Newsletter (2025-05-09 #091)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the ninety-first issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. In this issue, we will bring you some interesting tutorials related to Milk-V Duo.

## Highlights

+ A developer utilized the Milk-V Duo development board, based on RISC-V architecture, to fully implement the design and development of a smart car. The process covered hardware assembly, software programming, and detailed documentation on board functionality, sensor drivers (such as ultrasonic modules and motor control), and system optimization. The project successfully achieved autonomous obstacle avoidance and remote control capabilities. The open-sourced code and circuit design provide a practical reference for embedded development and RISC-V ecosystem exploration.
