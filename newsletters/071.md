Welcome to the seventy-first issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. In this issue, we bring you a series of news over Milk-V Duo.

## Highlights

+ Recently, Professor Tianyu Jia from the School of Integrated Circuits at Peking University conducted his course, Modern SoC Processor Architecture Design, as scheduled. Dr. Liuxi Yang, Chief Scientist of SOPHGO, and Mingjun Zhang, Processor Architect, were invited to deliver a lecture to doctoral students on RXU high-performance general-purpose processor design.

  Through this collaboration with Peking University, SOPHGO brings advanced processor design concepts and methodologies into academia, inspiring more young talents to pursue careers in RISC-V high-performance processor design and contributing to the cultivation of much-needed professionals.
