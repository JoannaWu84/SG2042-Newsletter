# SG2042 Newsletter (2023-11-17 #017)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the seventeenth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. In this issue, we will bring you the great news that SG2042 has made significant breakthroughs in compatibility testing with TiDB!

## Highlights

+ With the support of the open-source community, TiDB has been successfully adapted to SG2042 and runs smoothly. This achievement marks the first successful migration and testing of an enterprise-level distributed relational database on the RISC-V processor platform, realizing the commercial feasibility of large-scale distributed transaction processing and analysis in industries such as finance, Internet, and power. Furthermore, it makes significant contributions to the progress of the RISC-V software ecosystem.
