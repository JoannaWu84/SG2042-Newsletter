## Highlights

+ On April 29, 2025, the 8th Digital China Summit grandly opened in Fuzhou. As a participating exhibitor, SOPHGO made an impressive appearance, with its booth attracting over ten thousand visitors eager to explore its innovative achievements. One of the key highlights was the next-generation RISC-V high-performance server powered by the SG2044 processor, which drew significant attention. This product adopts an internationally open-source instruction set architecture and is compatible with domestic operating systems, achieving full-stack autonomous control from hardware to software. It injects strong momentum into technological advancements and market expansion in the RISC-V high-performance general computing field.
