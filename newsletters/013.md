# SG2042 Newsletter (2023-10-20 #013)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the thirteenth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. We are thrilled to announce that the Shandong University-SOPHGO RISC-V Research Institute has been officially established. This is an important milestone that will greatly facilitate the promotion and application of RISC-V processors in China and provide strong technical support for industry development.

## Highlights

+ On October 13, 2023, the Shandong University-SOPHGO RISC-V Research Institute was officially announced, which is the first research institute in Chinese universities with RISC-V as its main research direction. The establishment of Shandong University-SOPHGO RISC-V Research Institute is not only a vibrant practice of combining industry, academia and research, but also demonstrates foresight, strategic significance and exemplar.

  RISC-V, as an open-source instruction set architecture, has received increasing attention and application in recent years. It has the advantages of flexibility, customizability and openness, bringing more opportunities for chip design and embedded systems. The collaboration between Shandong University and SOPHGO will promote in-depth research and wide application of RISC-V technology in China, providing new opportunities for the development of related fields.
