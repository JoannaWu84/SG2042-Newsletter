## Editor's Note

Welcome to the fifteenth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. In this issue, we will share with you the latest progress of Milk-V Duo, which has been successfully ported to more than 10 operating systems, including OpenEuler, ArchLinux, Fedora, Debian, OpenWRT, FreeRTOS, AliOS, RT-Thread, etc. Additionally, it has achieved compatibility with software stacks such as opencv-mobile, ncnn, and SQLite. Furthermore, Milk-V Duo supports over 50 sensors and is equipped with a built-in 0.2T AI computing power. These advances not only provide developers with more tools and resources, but also offer users a more diverse range of features and application experiences.

## Highlights

+ The Milk-V Duo software ecosystem has developed rapidly in a short period of time. Operating systems such as OpenWRT, FreeRTOS, AliOS and RT-Thread have been successfully ported and adapted to the Duo, enabling a wide range of applications for the Duo such as routers, gateways, IoT devices, wearables and robots.

  In addition, the global attention on Milk-V Duo is increasing. Within just three months, Duo's GitHub project has exceeded 500 stars, including opencv-mobile, the GitHub projects that have official native support for Duo have exceeded 20,000 stars. Simultaneously, the total online video views for Duo have exceeded 500,000 worldwide. These statistics indicate that Duo has gained widespread attention and recognition among developers and users. The continuous growth of its software ecosystem provides more potential and opportunities for Duo to be used in various fields.
